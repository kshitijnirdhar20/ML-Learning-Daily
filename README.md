# ML-Learning-Daily
# ðŸ§  ML Learning Daily ðŸš€

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Learning Journey**! This repository is my public commitment to learn and practice ML consistently â€” one day at a time.

I created this repo to:
- Track my daily ML practice and progress
- Share notebooks, code, and notes
- Build real projects step by step
- Keep my GitHub contribution streak alive ðŸŸ©

---

## ðŸ“… My Goal

> ðŸ“Œ **One meaningful ML-related commit per day.**

Whether itâ€™s a notebook, visualization, concept notes, or a small experiment â€” the goal is to learn something new and push it here daily.
