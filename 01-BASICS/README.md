# 🧠 Python Basics for Machine Learning

This folder contains foundational Python programs and practice notebooks that are essential for getting started with Machine Learning.

These notebooks help build logic, understand syntax, and work with basic Python data structures.

## 📂 Contents

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GREATER_USING_IF_ELSE.ipynb` | Program to find the greater number using `if-else` |
| `ODD_OR_LEAP.ipynb` | Check if a number is odd or a leap year |
| `TRIANGLE.ipynb` | Determines triangle type based on angles/sides |
| `PYTHON_LIST.ipynb` | Practice with Python lists (append, sort, etc.) |
| `PYTHON_TUPLE_AND_SET.ipynb` | Intro to tuple and set operations in Python |

## 🎯 Objective

To strengthen Python basics including:
- Conditional logic
- Loops and flow control
- Lists, tuples, sets
- Writing clean, readable code

This will serve as a strong base before moving into NumPy, Pandas, and ML algorithms.

---

## 🔁 Next Steps

- Add more notebooks on:
  - Loops (`for`, `while`)
  - Functions
  - Dictionaries
- Begin using **NumPy** for numerical computing
